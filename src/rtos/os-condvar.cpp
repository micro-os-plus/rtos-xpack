    /**
     * @class condition_variable
     * @details
     * A condition variable is a synchronisation object which allows a thread
     * to suspend execution, repeatedly, until some associated predicate
     * becomes true. A thread whose execution is suspended on a condition
     * variable is said to be blocked on the condition variable.
     *
     * @par Scheduling Behaviour of Condition Variables
     *
     * Synchronisation primitives that attempt to interfere with
     * scheduling policy by specifying an ordering rule are considered
     * undesirable. Threads waiting on mutexes and condition variables
     * are selected to proceed in an order dependent upon the scheduling
     * policy rather than in some fixed order (for example, FIFO or
     * priority). Thus, the scheduling policy determines which
     * thread(s) are awakened and allowed to proceed.
     *
     * @par Cancellation and Condition Wait
     *
     * A condition wait, whether timed or not, is a cancellation
     * point. That is, the functions `wait()`
     * or `timed_wait()` are points where a pending
     * (or concurrent) cancellation request is noticed. The reason
     * for this is that an indefinite wait is possible at these
     * points-whatever event is being waited for, even if the
     * program is totally correct, might never occur; for example,
     * some input data being awaited might never be sent. By
     * making condition wait a cancellation point, the thread can
     * be cancelled and perform its cancellation cleanup handler
     * even though it may be stuck in some indefinite wait.
     *
     * A side-effect of acting on a cancellation request while a
     * thread is blocked on a condition variable is to re-acquire
     * the mutex before calling any of the cancellation cleanup
     * handlers. This is done in order to ensure that the
     * cancellation cleanup handler is executed in the same
     * state as the critical code that lies both before and
     * after the call to the condition wait function. This
     * rule is also required when interfacing to POSIX threads
     * from languages, such as Ada or C++, which may choose
     * to map cancellation onto a language exception; this rule
     * ensures that each exception handler guarding a critical
     * section can always safely depend upon the fact that
     * the associated mutex has already been locked regardless
     * of exactly where within the critical section the
     * exception was raised. Without this rule, there would
     * not be a uniform rule that exception handlers could
     * follow regarding the lock, and so coding would become
     * very cumbersome.
     *
     * Therefore, since some statement has to be made regarding
     * the state of the lock when a cancellation is delivered
     * during a wait, a definition has been chosen that makes
     * application coding most convenient and error free.
     *
     * When acting on a cancellation request while a thread
     * is blocked on a condition variable, the implementation
     * is required to ensure that the thread does not consume
     * any condition signals directed at that condition variable
     * if there are any other threads waiting on that condition
     * variable. This rule is specified in order to avoid deadlock
     * conditions that could occur if these two independent
     * requests (one acting on a thread and the other acting on
     * the condition variable) were not processed independently.
     *
     * @par Performance of Mutexes and Condition Variables
     *
     * Mutexes are expected to be locked only for a few
     * instructions. This practice is almost automatically
     * enforced by the desire of programmers to avoid long
     * serial regions of execution (which would reduce total
     * effective parallelism).
     *
     * When using mutexes and condition variables, one tries
     * to ensure that the usual case is to lock the mutex,
     * access shared data, and unlock the mutex. Waiting on
     * a condition variable should be a relatively rare
     * situation. For example, when implementing a read-write
     * lock, code that acquires a read-lock typically needs
     * only to increment the count of readers
     * (under mutual-exclusion) and return. The calling
     * thread would actually wait on the condition variable
     * only when there is already an active writer. So the
     * efficiency of a synchronisation operation is bounded
     * by the cost of mutex lock/unlock and not by condition
     * wait. Note that in the usual case there is no context switch.
     *
     * This is not to say that the efficiency of condition
     * waiting is unimportant. Since there needs to be at
     * least one context switch per Ada rendezvous, the
     * efficiency of waiting on a condition variable is
     * important. The cost of waiting on a condition variable
     * should be little more than the minimal cost for a context
     * switch plus the time to unlock and lock the mutex.
     *
     * @par Example
     *
     * @code{.cpp}
     * mutex mx;
     * condition_variable cv;
     *
     * void
     * consumer(void)
     * {
     *   // Do something
     *   mx.lock();
     *   // ...
     *   while(!condition())
     *     {
     *       // ...
     *       cv.wait();
     *       // ...
     *     }
     *   // ...
     *   mx.unlock(mx);
     *   // Do something else.
     * }
     *
     * void
     * producer(void)
     * {
     *   // Do something
     *   mx.lock();
     *   // ...
     *   if (some_condition())
     *     {
     *       // ...
     *       cv.signal();
     *       // ...
     *     }
     *   // ...

     * by another thread to the mutex and then the condition variable".
     * That is, if another thread is able to acquire the mutex
     * after the about-to-block thread has released it, then a
     * subsequent call to `broadcast()` or
     * `signal()` in that thread shall behave
     * as if it were issued after the about-to-block thread has blocked.
     *
     * Upon successful return, the mutex shall have been locked and
     * shall be owned by the calling thread. If _mutex_ is a robust
     * mutex where an owner terminated while holding the lock and
     * the state is recoverable, the mutex shall be acquired even
     * though the function returns an error code.
     *
     * When using condition variables there is always a Boolean
     * predicate involving shared variables associated with each
     * condition wait that is true if the thread should proceed.
     * Spurious wakeups from the `timed_wait()`
     * functions may occur. Since
     * the return from `timed_wait()`
     * does not imply anything about
     * the value of this predicate, the predicate should be
     * re-evaluated upon such return.
     *
     * When a thread waits on a condition variable, having specified
     * a particular mutex to either the `timed_wait()`
     * operation, a dynamic
     * binding is formed between that mutex and condition variable
     * that remains in effect as long as at least one thread is
     * blocked on the condition variable. During this time, the
     * effect of an attempt by any thread to wait on that condition
     * variable using a different mutex is undefined. Once all
     * waiting threads have been unblocked (as by the
     * `broadcast()` operation), the next wait
     * operation on that condition variable shall form a new
     * dynamic binding with the mutex specified by that wait
     * operation. Even though the dynamic binding between
     * condition variable and _mutex_ may be removed or replaced
     * between the time a thread is unblocked from a wait on the
     * condition variable and the time that it returns to the
     * caller or begins cancellation cleanup, the unblocked
     * thread shall always re-acquire the mutex specified in
     * the condition wait operation call from which it is returning.
     *
     * A condition wait (whether timed or not) is a cancellation
     * point. When the cancellability type of a thread is set to
     * PTHREAD_CANCEL_DEFERRED, a side-effect of acting upon a
     * cancellation request while in a condition wait is that
     * the mutex is (in effect) re-acquired before calling the
     * first cancellation cleanup handler. The effect is as if
     * the thread were unblocked, allowed to execute up to the
     * point of returning from the call to
     * `timed_wait()`, but at that point notices
     * the cancellation request and instead of returning to the
     * caller of `timed_wait()` or
     * `wait()`, starts the thread cancellation
     * activities, which includes calling cancellation cleanup handlers.
     *
     * A thread that has been unblocked because it has been cancelled
     * while blocked in a call to `timed_wait()`
     * shall not consume any condition
     * signal that may be directed concurrently at the condition
     * variable if there are other threads blocked on the condition
     * variable.
     *
     * The `timed_wait()` function shall be
     * equivalent to `wait()`, except that an
     * error is returned if the timeout specified by _timeout_
     * passes (that is, system time equals or exceeds now() + timeout) before
     * the condition cond is signalled or broadcasted. When such timeouts occur,
     * `timed_wait()` shall nonetheless release
     * and re-acquire the mutex referenced by _mutex_, and may consume
     * a condition signal directed concurrently at the condition variable.
     *
     * The condition variable shall have a clock attribute which
     * specifies the clock that shall be used to measure the time
     * specified by the _ticks_ argument. The
     * `timed_wait()` function is also a
     * cancellation point.
     * The resolution of the timeout shall be the resolution of the
     * clock on which it is based (by default the SysTick clock for CMSIS).
