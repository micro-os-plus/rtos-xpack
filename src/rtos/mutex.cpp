     *
     * The mutex protocol is defined via the `protocol` attribute of
     * the `mutex::attributes` class. Valid values are:
     *
     * - `mutex::protocol::none`
     * - `mutex::protocol::inherit`
     * - `mutex::protocol::protect`
     *
     * When a thread owns a mutex with the `mutex::protocol::none`
     * protocol attribute, its priority and scheduling shall
     * not be affected by its mutex ownership.
     *
     * When a thread is blocking higher priority threads
     * because of owning one or more robust mutexes with the
     * `mutex::protocol::inherit` protocol attribute, it shall execute
     * at the higher of its priority or the priority of the highest
     * priority thread waiting on any of the robust mutexes owned
     * by this thread and initialised with this protocol.
     *
     * When a thread is blocking higher priority threads
     * because of owning one or more non-robust mutexes with the
     * `mutex::protocol::inherit` protocol attribute, it shall execute
     * at the higher of its priority or the priority of the highest
     * priority thread waiting on any of the non-robust mutexes owned
     * by this thread and initialised with this protocol.
     *
     * When a thread owns one or more robust mutexes initialised
     * with the `mutex::protocol::protect` protocol, it shall execute
     * at the higher of its priority or the highest of the priority
     * ceilings of all the robust mutexes owned by this thread and
     * initialised with this attribute, regardless of whether other
     * threads are blocked on any of these robust mutexes or not.
     *
     * When a thread owns one or more non-robust mutexes initialised
     * with the `mutex::protocol::protect` protocol, it shall execute
     * at the higher of its priority or the highest of the priority
     * ceilings of all the non-robust mutexes owned by this thread and
     * initialised with this attribute, regardless of whether other
     * threads are blocked on any of these non-robust mutexes or not.
     *
     * If a thread simultaneously owns several mutexes initialised
     * with different protocols, it shall execute at the highest of
     * the priorities that it would have obtained by each of these
     * protocols (this requirement makes most of the specific max
     * requirements above irrelevant, a global max is easier to compute).
     *
     * While a thread is holding a mutex which has been initialised with
     * the `mutex::protocol::inherit` or `mutex::protocol::protect` protocol
     * attributes, it shall not be subject to being moved to the tail
     * of the scheduling queue at its priority in the event that its
     * original priority is changed, such as by a call to
     * thread::priority(int). Likewise, when a thread unlocks a mutex
     * that has been initialised with the `mutex::protocol::inherit` or
     * `mutex::protocol::protect` protocol attributes, it shall not be
     * subject to being moved to the tail of the scheduling queue
     * at its priority in the event that its original priority is changed
     * (ILG: not sure what this means, currently after `unlock()` the thread
     * priority returns to the assigned priority).
     *
     * When a thread makes a call to `mutex::lock()`, the mutex
     * was initialised with the protocol attribute having the
     * value `mutex::protocol::inherit`, when the calling thread is
     * blocked because the mutex is owned by another thread, that
     * owner thread shall inherit the priority level of the calling
     * thread as long as it continues to own the mutex. The
     * implementation shall update its execution priority to
     * the maximum of its assigned priority and all its
     * inherited priorities. Furthermore, if this owner thread
     * itself becomes blocked on another mutex with the protocol
     * attribute having the value `mutex::protocol::inherit`, the same
     * priority inheritance effect shall be propagated to this
     * other owner thread, in a recursive manner.

     * @class mutex
     * @details
     * A synchronisation object used to allow multiple threads to serialise
     * their access to shared data. The name derives from the capability
     * it provides; namely, **mutual-exclusion**. The thread that has locked
     * a mutex becomes its owner and remains the owner until that same
     * thread unlocks the mutex.
     *
     * @par Tradeoff Between Error Checks and Performance Supported
     *
     * Many error conditions that can occur are not required to be
     * detected by the implementation in order to let implementations
     * trade off performance versus degree of error checking according
     * to the needs of their specific applications and execution
     * environment. As a general rule, conditions caused by the
     * system (such as insufficient memory) are required to be
     * detected, but conditions caused by an erroneously coded
     * application (such as failing to provide adequate synchronisation
     * to prevent a mutex from being deleted while in use) are
     * specified to result in undefined behaviour.
     *
     * A wide range of implementations is thus made possible. For
     * example, an implementation intended for application debugging
     * may implement all of the error checks, but an implementation
     * running a single, provably correct application under very tight
     * performance constraints in an embedded computer might implement
     * minimal checks. An implementation might even be provided in two
     * versions, similar to the options that compilers provide: a
     * full-checking, but slower version; and a limited-checking, but
     * faster version. To forbid this optionality would be a disservice
     * to users.
     *
     * By carefully limiting the use of "undefined behaviour" only to
     * things that an erroneous (badly coded) application might do,
     * and by defining that resource-not-available errors are mandatory,
     * POSIX ensures that a fully-conforming application is portable across
     * the full range of implementations, while not forcing all
     * implementations to add overhead to check for numerous things
     * that a correct program never does. When the behaviour is
     * undefined, no error number is specified to be returned on
     * implementations that do detect the condition. This is because
     * undefined behaviour means anything can happen, which includes
     * returning with any value (which might happen to be a valid, but
     * different, error number). However, since the error number might
     * be useful to application developers when diagnosing problems
     * during application development, a recommendation is made in
     * rationale that implementors should return a particular error
     * number if their implementation does detect the condition.
     *
     * @par Static Initialisers
     *
     * Providing for static initialisation of statically allocated
     * synchronisation objects allows modules with private static
     * synchronisation variables to avoid runtime initialisation
     * tests and overhead. Furthermore, it simplifies the coding of
     * self-initialising modules. Such modules are common in C
     * libraries, where for various reasons the design calls for
     * self-initialisation instead of requiring an explicit module
     * initialisation function to be called. An example use of
     * static initialisation:
     *
     * @code{.cpp}
     * // Construct a normal mutex. Same as using the default constructor.
     * mutex mx { "mx1" };
     *
     * // Construct a recursive mutex.
     * mutex_recursive rmx { "mx2" };
     * @endcode
     *
     * @par Example
     *
     * @code{.cpp}
     * // Protected resource.
     * typedef struct {
     *   int count;
     * } res_t;
     *
     * res_t res;
     *
     * // Mutex to protect the resource.
     * mutex mx;
     *
     * void
     * function(void)
     * {
     *   // Do something
     *
     *   mx.lock();
     *   res.count++;
     *   mx.unlock();
